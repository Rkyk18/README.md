Quick summary (TL;DR)

What: $IACS is the Omniacs.DAO token (appears to be a Base-chain project listed as “Omniacs.DAO / IACS”). 

Price & market size: $203K market cap** (small-cap / micro-cap). 24-hour trading volume is low (≈ $1–1.4K), and liquidity on DEXes appears limited. 

Supply & tokenomics: Total supply appears listed as 1,000,000,000 IACS and a public-auction allocation of ~37.5% (remainder split not fully detailed publicly). Treat tokenomics as self-reported and incomplete until an official whitepaper / contract allocation table is posted. 

Community & distribution: On-chain snapshots show ~3.3K holders (indicative of modest distribution), and liquidity pools appear small — both point to high volatility and low depth. 

Key metrics (source-backed)

(I pulled live/near-live on-chain aggregator pages and project social posts — see citations after each statement.)

Price: $0.000197 USD (live DEX/price pages). 

Market cap: ~$202.9K USD (interface / market page). 

24h volume: ~$1–1.4K USD (low volume → high slippage risk). 

Liquidity (reported): ~$30K USD in pools (limited depth). 

Holders: ~3.3K addresses. 

Total supply & allocation snippet: 1,000,000,000 IACS; 37.5% Public Auction (self-reported social posts). 

I also created a compact table and a tokenomics pie chart (high-level) for quick visual reference — see the table & chart displayed above
Short qualitative take — fresh perspectives

1. Liquidity + volume risk: Market cap and volumes are small. For traders this means significant slippage on orders and vulnerability to price manipulation; for holders this means marked short-term volatility. (Metric sources: market pages). 

2. Tokenomics transparency matters: A large public auction slice (37.5%) can be positive for decentralised distribution, but the remainder (62.5%) needs clarity — team allocation, vesting, treasury, incentives, and liquidity bootstrapping details are missing from public, easily-verifiable docs. Without a clear vesting schedule and on-chain timelocks, there's tail risk from large unlocks. (Source: project social posts / pie graphic — self-reported). 

3. Utility & roadmap signal weak: Omniacs.DAO social posts mention adding utility, but specifics remain light. For micro-cap tokens, the presence of a clear short-term utility (staking, fee share, product usage) materially changes risk profile — absence of it keeps this firmly speculative. 

4. On-chain health check: ~3.3K holders is healthy enough to indicate community interest, but not broad adoption. Monitor concentration metrics (top-holders %), DEX pool composition, and lock statuses (team/treasury locked vs. unlocked). These on-chain factors will determine how quickly price can be moved. 

5. Catalysts to watch: (a) Official tokenomics/whitepaper release with vesting schedule; (b) listings on deeper liquidity venues / centralized exchange; (c) clear product utility / integrations announced by the team. Absent these, $IACS remains a high-risk, speculation-first token.

Risk checklist (quick)

Low liquidity & low daily volume → high slippage and manipulation risk. 

Tokenomics partly self-reported; need formal docs & vesting schedule → unlock risk. 

Small market cap → price hypersensitivity to buys/sells. 

Suggested next steps (if you want to dig deeper)

1. Share the IACS contract address (if you have it) so I can inspect holders concentration, timelocks, and transfer history.


2. I can run a short watchlist checklist: top-10 holders %; recent large transfers; liquidity pool token ratios; and any vesting timelock contracts — all using the token contract. (If you want this, paste the contract address or paste links you trust.)
